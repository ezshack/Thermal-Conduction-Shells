# Thermal-Conduction-Shells
One dimensional thermal conduction through solid layers of a sphere.
The current version is functional but incomplete. Further work needed.

For this problem, I needed to borrow a bit of expertise from mudkip-hacker. They figured out what physics equation to use and translated it to a console demo. I then deconstructed it, figured out how it applied the math, and implimented it in Unity3D.

The issue stems from needing the heat of the layers in order as a parameter for both magnetic fields and tectonics. For magnetic fields, it determines the power of the dynamo the protects the planet from the star. For tectonics, it determines the speed at which plates move along the surface of the planet. Heat will also determine the amounts and types of liquid found on planet surfaces and clouds.

A detailed description will be written soon, to demonstrate how the method works.
